# Data-processing-ML-Final-Project

At the final project of the course in [Machine Learning](https://studiegids.uva.nl/xmlpages/page/2019-2020-en/search-course/course/71327) that I took at the UvA, me and my teammates studied the influence of a neighbourhood on the percentage of smokers and alcohol consumption. In order to do this, we took three different datasets that the dutch government publishes every year...

I was responsible of the data processing, which was necessary for a coherent dataframe on which to use the chosen Machine Learning models.
